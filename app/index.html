      <h1>Recipe</h1>
      <p>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
        
        Place the quartered squash onto a half sheet pan, brush the flesh of the 
        squash with a little butter and season with 1 tablespoon of the salt and 
        1 teaspoon of the white pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 30 to 35 
        minutes or until the flesh is soft and tender.
        
        Scoop the flesh from the skin into a 6-quart pot. Add the broth, honey and 
        ginger. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, approximately 7 to 8 
        minutes. Using a stick blender, puree the mixture until smooth*. Stir in the 
        heavy cream and return to a low simmer. Season with the remaining salt, 
        pepper, and nutmeg.
        
        *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool 
        for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and 
        fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the 
        lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a 
        towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high 
        speed until smooth.</p>
